# Sharepoint-List-New-Records-Filter-Excel-VBA-
VBA macro for Excel that automates filtering and detecting new records from a SharePoint list export (via .iqy file). The macro compares previously processed records with the current ones, updates a "new records" section, format the visit name in a single row, and logs the last consulted date.
